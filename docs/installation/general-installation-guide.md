Installation Guide
---
You have 3 choices:
 - If you want just _to see the app_, take a look at one of our environments like [UAT](http://uat.jtalks.org/jcommune). You can register a user, create topics, code review, etc.
 - If you'd like to run it locally, install the project from binaries (war file), see below.
 - If you want to contribute, you may want to build it from sources.

So if you want to run the app locally, you need to install basic environment:
 - [Instruction for Debian/Ubuntu](linux/basic-environment.md)
 - [Instruction for Windows](windows/basic-environment.md)
